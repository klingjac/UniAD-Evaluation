This file details the changes made to run UniAD and reproduce the results shown in our paper.
Install instructions are almost identical to those shown in the ReadMe file, however this repo should be used in place of the original repo.
Additionally, when installing CUDA in your conda environment, it should be done with the following:
conda install -c omgarcia gcc-6
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.1
conda install -c conda-forge mamba
mamba install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit-dev=11.1

All other installation instructions should be the same. 

Note: Results were gathered from the mini-nuScenes dataset, so when preparing the dataset, the mini set should be used.
Additionally, all evaluation was done on a single GPU.

The model evaulation can be run similar to how it is done in the README, but quantitative evaulation is done through modified scripts.
In the directory: /UniAD/tools/analysis_tools/visualize
run2.py & run3.py can be utilized to calculate a generalized 2D & 3D IoU, which is not done by the original run.py script.

Additionally, an avg.py script exists in the main directory to average BEV IoU results that are originally produced by the detection network. This can be run after
running the detection network and changing the respective test folder location. Finally, a remaining bev_imager.py file exists to produce an alternative BEV plot for each
camera instance.
